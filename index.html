            The first distinctive sign of the brand appeared in 1949, when Adolf Dassler invented the three bands that adorn the leather of shoes and reinforce them. This logo is associated with the slogan "the brand with 3 stripes". The 1960s marked the diversification of the company, which launched branded balls in 1964 and tracksuits in 1968.

            It is for sportswear and equipment (bags, balls, etc.) that adidas redesigns its logo: the three stripes cross horizontally a three-leaf clover which symbolizes the diversity of the group, the three leaves representing the three main landmasses of the world and the group's three major markets (the Americas, Europe/Africa and Asia).
            
            In 1972, the brand became the official sponsor of the Munich Olympics and the "trefoil" was launched on this occasion.

            In 1991, the brand launched, under the new adidas Equipment division (future adidas Sport Performance in 2002), a line of functional shoes and clothing that were directly geared towards sports performance. Their logo, the "three bars", symbolizes, through the mountain, the challenge and the goal to be achieved. The Originals division, created in 1993 (future Sport HÃ©ritage in 2002), brought the clover back up to date,abandoned at the end of the 1980s and then brought up to date for "vintage" series reissuing old the brand in the 2000.
